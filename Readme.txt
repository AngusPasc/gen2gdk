Installation:

	Run Gen2_Config.exe and check the version of Delphi that you use.
		If, for some reason, that doesn't work
		you can install Gen2 manually:

	Add the following paths to your Delphi library and you are set:
		Gen2_v#\
		Gen2_v#\Mods\
		Gen2_v#\Utils\

Compiling shaders:

	To reduce the size of the original archive the compiled shader files
	have been removed from the package. After installing the GDK you will
	need to manually compile the shaders. To do so run Gen2_Config.exe,
	under the Shaders tab click Compile.
