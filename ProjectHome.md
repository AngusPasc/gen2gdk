# Gen2 #
Gen2 is an open source game engine for Delphi.
It is base on **[DirectX9](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX)** and allows **[Delphi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeGear_Delphi)** users to create 2D and 3D games for Windows.

## Core components of the engine ##
  * Graphics engine based on [Direct3D9](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Direct3D)
  * Sound engine based on [DirectSound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectSound), [DirectMusic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectMusic) and [DirectShow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectShow)
  * Keyboard and mouse input handling through [DirectInput](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectInput)
  * A set of tools for networking

## Game development tools ##
  * Sprite engine for 2D games with built in physics
  * Scene manager for 3D games with built in physics and programmable render
  * More sophisticated physics is accessible through Newton Game Dynamics
  * Automatic rag doll generation from g2m meshes
  * Easy access to render target textures including cube map render targets
  * Highly optimized and easily extensible 3D particle engine
  * A g2m mesh format that supports static, animated, skinned meshes as well as entire scenes with lights, multitexturing and meta information
  * Standard mesh render through sm 3.0 and fixed function for lower end PCs
  * Skinnable graphical user interface
  * 2D and 3D landscapes
  * Path finding and other useful utilities

## Utilities ##
  * 3DS Max plug-ins for export of DirectX(.x) and Gen2(.g2m) meshes
  * Mesh viewer for .x and .g2m formats
  * Texture viewer for bmp, jpg, tga, png, ppm, dib, hdr, pfm and dds formats
  * Resource packer program with compression and encryption
  * A program for stitching several images into a single animation texture
